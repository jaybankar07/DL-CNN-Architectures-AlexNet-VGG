# DL-CNN-Architectures-AlexNet-VGG
This lab focuses on implementing and comparing two widely known CNN architectures: AlexNet and VGG. The goal of the experiment is to understand how architectural depth, convolutional layer sizes, and parameter count affect model performance on a binary image classification task.
